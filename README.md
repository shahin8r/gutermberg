#  Gutermberg - WIP
A syntax highlighter plugin for Gutenberg in WordPress with a terminal UI.

**In a very early stage of development**.

## Built with
- [create-guten-block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block)
- [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter)
- [react-ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace)

## Why another syntax highlighter plugin?
I wanted to embed code on my personal website in a nice looking terminal. Not only that, I wanted to have all of the CSS for the terminal/code inline when I fetch blog posts from the WP Rest API. Thanks to [react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/conorhastings/react-syntax-highlighter) inline CSS support, this is possible.
